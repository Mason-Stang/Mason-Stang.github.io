I used Bootstrap 3 for customizing the nav bar, and jquery for implementing the nav bar easing effect. I used the parallax.js library for implementing the parallax effect on certain images. Finally, ms.css file was developed from the cs33.css file of the Brown Computer Science class CS0330 website.
