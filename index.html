              <h4>Backend Software Engineering Intern, <i>Summer 2022</i></h4>
              <p>
                I was thrilled to join the engineering team at Exabeam, a cybersecurity
                company that offers a cloud-native platform enabling client companies
                to track and mitigate security threats. My team was
                building the next-gen Alert and Case Management application.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>
                  In my role as a backend developer, I implemented an ingestion
                  pipeline to download JSON data from Google Cloud Storage and
                  Pub/Sub, deserialize, and persist the data to a Spanner
                  database – this pipeline was launched in production as
                  part of our ACM application.
                </b>
                My other projects included writing and debugging Spring RESTful
                APIs using the Spring Framework, which facilitated the communication
                between the ACM application’s backend and frontend. My extensive unit
                tests suites for Spring APIs, mappers and services achieved >95% line coverage.
              </p>
              <p>
                I enjoyed every bit of my time at Exabeam, in large part because Exabeam
                welcomed me from day one. My managers and coworkers couldn’t have been
                friendlier. I’m so thankful for my amazing mentors, who generously offered
                hours of their time to work with me. I thrived in Exabeam’s environment,
                even delivering an hour long company-wide presentation on sailing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, Exabeam launched my interest in software engineering. I
                discovered a passion for building products that change people’s
                lives for the better.

              <p>
                Working as a sailing instructor at Spinnaker Sailing was an opportunity
                I couldn’t pass up. Who wouldn’t want to spend the summertime on a sailboat
                on San Francisco Bay, teaching the sport you love?
              </p>
              <p>
                At Spinnaker Sailing, I taught multi-day, introductory on-the-water
                sailing courses for adults.
                <b>
                  By the end of the season, I had taught dozens of adults the basic
                  skills required to sail a small keelboat.
                </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                There’s nothing like skippering a 21ft sailboat with a crew of wide-eyed
                students, many of whom have never set foot on a sailboat before,
                and bringing them up to a level where they could sail confidently
                on their own. I myself am an experienced sailor, having raced sailboats
                for most of my life, but teaching that skill to others from the very
                basics was a whole new challenge. Through practiced presentation and
                communication, I was able to impart my knowledge to my students.
              </p>
              <p>
                More than anything, I appreciate the opportunity to share my passion
                for sailing with others. Us sailors have a responsibility to promote
                our sport to the general population, and I’m glad to have made an
                impact in that way.

              <h4>Software Engineering Intern, Design Verification Testing Lab, <i>Summer 2019</i></h4>
              <p>
                My time at Avalanche was the perfect introduction to the tech industry.
                An exciting and dynamic startup, Avalanche was developing a new MRAM memory
                device that would offer superior performance to existing products.
                I couldn’t wait to get involved.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s not at every tech company that you get to work hands-on with the physical
                product. But at Avalanche, I did exactly that – generating Bash test
                scripts, testing hundreds of memory chips one by one, searching for
                read/write errors and identifying their causes. I dove into the task
                of pushing the chips to their limits, testing them in different ways
                with modified Bash scripts. My coworkers and I even went so far as
                to test their performance in a 500&#176;F oven. I wasn’t just
                troubleshooting, I was exploring. Exploring what made the product work,
                what made if fail, and ultimately what made it tick at a deeper level.
              </p>
              <p>
                I could not have had a better experience at Avalanche. I found it
                incredibly rewarding to know I was making an impact at a real startup,
                especially at such a young age. All in all, Avalanche set me on the path
                of engineering. It helped me discover my love for building new things
                and working on the forefront of technological innovation. Going forward,
                I knew those were the interests I would pursue.
