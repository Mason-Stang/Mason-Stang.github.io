              CS0330 is taught by
              <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~twd/"
                >Professor Tom Doeppner (twd)</a
              >. Lectures are held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, from
              2:00 to 2:50 PM at MacMillan 117, and are also recorded on
              panopto and will be uploaded after each lecture.
            </p>
            <p>
              The course is intended primarily for computer science students
              and computer engineers, though it's open to anyone with adequate
              preparation interested in learning the topics covered in the
              course announcement. It fulfills a core requirement for the A.B.
              and Sc.B. tracks in computer science, and is required for the
              Computer Engineering concentration.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to take CS 33, you should have taken CS 16, CS 18, CS
              19, or CS 200 (or have Tom's permission). Familiarity with a
              C-like language (such as C++ or Java) will help you with this
              course. However, knowing C is not a prerequisite for the course.

              Extensive programming exercises introduce students to
              systems-level programming on Linux systems, as well as to
              multithreaded programming with POSIX threads.
              <br />
              Students will learn the basics of how compilers work and will be

    <p>My interests section</p>
    <p>My name is Mason Stang. I am a rising sophomore at Brown and I am hoping to be accepted into ENGN 1010 this fall. At Brown, I am concentrating in Computer Science and Economics. In addition to my concentration requirements, I have taken many engineering courses in order to gain a more well-rounded technical background. I plan to complete the Entrepreneurship Certificate as well, and to this end I have already taken ENGN 90. Outside of academics, I compete for Brown’s Varsity Sailing Team. I believe I have already taken a deep dive into entrepreneurship, from completing U Penn’s Social Innovators Program in high school, to taking ENGN 90, to even writing and publishing my own book about sailboat racing. I can’t wait to take ENGN 1010 as I continue further along Brown’s entrepreneurship pathway.
      Having lived in the San Francisco Bay Area all my life, I have come to love and appreciate the innovation happening in Silicon Valley. I’m drawn to the process of identifying an unmet need or opportunity for improvement in some aspect of people’s lives, coming up with a solution, and expanding that solution to as many people as possible. Driving down the highway and passing by the thousands of companies in my area – not just the Googles and Facebooks of the Valley, but the smaller, rapidly expanding startups just coming to light – inspires me every day to analyze the world as it is now and ask myself: what will be the next big thing?
      I want to take this course because I know that someday I would like to start my own business, or at least be an early contributor to a startup, and I believe that learning a structured and methodical approach to entrepreneurship in ENGN 1010 would benefit me greatly. I am excited to review case studies about other companies’ stories, not just to learn how to make decisions in real world business situations, but to discuss the case with others in a Socratic Discussion setting. In ENGN 90 we reviewed case studies as well, but participation in class only amounted to students answering questions asked by Thano, while in ENGN 1010 I will have the opportunity to directly discuss cases with other students. I believe I will take away so much more from a class in this Socratic Discussion setting.
      While I’m excited about the learning content of ENGN 1010, I am just as interested in the social aspect of taking this class. I can’t wait to meet other highly motivated students who are interested in entrepreneurship, and to join the Warshay Innovation Network. I view this class as a networking opportunity just as much as an academic opportunity, and I will be sure to make an effort to get to know my fellow classmates. I realize that these people will someday be my business partners, my first customers, or my first investors. This class is an opportunity to really build a lot of meaningful personal connections, something which I will be sure to prioritize in the fall.
